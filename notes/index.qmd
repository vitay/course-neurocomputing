# Course description {.unnumbered}

These are the lecture notes for the module **Neurocomputing** taught by Dr. Julien Vitay at the Technische Universität Chemnitz, Faculty of Computer Science, Professorship for Artificial Intelligence. 

Each section/lecture is accompanied by a set of videos, the slides and some lecture notes which summarize the most important points to understand. Some sections are optional in the sense that no questions will be asked at the exam, but those interested in becoming neural network experts should feel free to study them. The videos are integrated in the lecture notes, but you can also access the complete playlist on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIEjdhhAF7ULrnVFYX3Alx3Cv0Wv9ybgU).

Exercises are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks, allowing to implement in Python at your own pace the algorithms seen in the lectures and learn to use machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `keras` and `tensorflow`. A notebook to work on (locally or on Colab) and the solution are downloadable at the top of each page. A video explaining the exercise and one commenting the solution are available, with the playlist being on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIEjdhhAF7ULpZTu2sKkchFkvcxN8EQNv).
